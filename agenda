For TMACS 1.3:
 - Group character-inserts (and deletes?) into single undo records.

Possible safety holes:
 - Errors at or near memory limits?  (small memory, or big files)

Size reduction:
  - Move mx_buf to the end of the .COM file to allow built-in macros, and
    do Ctrl-T and word-wise operations as macros.

For TMACS 2.x:
 - Multiple buffers (in memory or on disk)
 - status line (current line number)
 - Restore value of unsaved after undo.

Never (maybe?):
 - stack of marks; "set mark" => push point;  "pop mark" => pop point off stack
 - Allow "execution" of files:  For help files, use the beginning of
   the file as macro definitions, and the rest of the file as
   data... (Info mode)
 - Write a macro compiler (HLL -> macro text),  and code patching program.
   Command to save current macro state to disk?  (patching the executable?)
